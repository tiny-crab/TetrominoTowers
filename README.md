# TetrominoTowers
Board game about building towers and knocking down your opponents'.

## Overview
<Tetromino Towers> (Name TBD) is a two-player board game centered around building towers, increasing your city's power, and using your power to destroy your opponent's city.
  
You use three components to play the game: buildings, floors, and weapons.

Buildings are represented by a stack of Legos, tiles, or anything you wish. Create a grid to place your buildings in. The default board is a 2x3 rectangular grid, but you can liven things up by choosing an L- or T-shaped tetris piece, or other rectangles of various sizes. I would advise keeping the number of slots below 6, as it can be somewhat overwhelming to manage more than that many buildings at once.

Buildings are constructed with floor cards. Each type of building (of which there are several) will have a handful of unique floor types that dictate what abilities those buildings can use in a turn. A basic floor (with no ability) is also available to expand your buildings at a lower price. Somewhere near your grid of buildings, you will keep your floor and building cards together to keep track of what floors compose a specific building in your grid.

Some buildings will affect your opponent's grid, but the most effective way to ensure your victory is to use weapons against your enemy's city (which will likely be toned down, as this game isn't intended to be grisly or grim). You can purchase infantry, tanks, and artillery to sit atop your buildings and blast your opponent. You can also purchase one-time-use weapons such as bombs or EMPs that are cheap, but can be disabled or defused if you're not careful.


## Table Setup
In the future, when the game is more stable, I imagine something like this:
* Take a single building card from each building type pile. Shuffle them all together, and draw four off the top. Place them face up and allow each player to see the combination of building types selected at random. After they've reflected and developed a potential strategy, each player can select one more building type card from the remaining building types. The unselected cards go back in the box.
* Take a single weapon card from each weapon type pile, and follow a similar process as the building types. Four cards are selected randomly, and each player may choose one at will. Set the unselected weapon cards back into the box.
* Finally, for each building type in play, find the respective floor cards for each building type. Each player can select a single floor card for each building type. Place each pile of floor cards underneath their respective building types on the table, and put the unused ones back in the box.

For now, every possible card will be in play, since balance is being worked out.

Place your building blocks and coin tokens off to the side where both players can reach. Select your favorite D6 die and set it nearby.

Place a city grid in front of each player. Each grid can be in any orientation that the player desires initially, but the grid squares need to be aligned (all grid lines are either parallel or exactly perpendicular to one another).

Place the staging mat (large squares numbered 0 - 7) in the center between the two players' grids.

## Game Setup
Players get 10 coins and can buy any buildings and floors they can afford. Weapons are not for sale until the first full round of play has completed.

## Game Flow
On any given turn, players will simultaneously follow this flow, waiting for every player to complete a step before moving to the next:

1. Rotate your city grid at 90 degree increments however many times you please. Once you proceed to another step, your grid's rotation will be locked.
2. Take note of how many buildings are exposed to your opponent (i.e. not blocked by another building on your grid). The number of buildings exposed is your "active" building number.
3. Buy up to X number of cards, where X is the number of "active" (exposed) buildings this round. Place all purchased cards on slot #7 on the staging mat.
4. Place up to X cards you would like to play this turn facedown in front of you, where X is the number of "active" (exposed) buildings this round. You may also place a single floor card from any active building on your grid and put it facedown with your other selected cards this turn.
5. Once you and your opponent have locked in the cards you would like to play this turn, pick up your selected cards and, without revealing them, place them facedown on the staging mat on the square that matches a cards' priority.
6. After each player has staged all of their cards in priority order, you may simultaneously reveal any cards in priority 0 and resolve their effects. 
7. Continue through each priority rank until you resolve all effects in priority 7. Take the cards you purchased at the beginning of the round (that had been set aside on priority 7) and place them on buildings you wish.

### Simultaneous Effects
For example, if both players choose to use a tank attack with the same priority, and attack each others' tank, both attacks will be carried out simultaneously and both tanks will be destroyed. If a tank attacks a building whose floor card is also active for a given priority, that floor will not be destroyed before it can use its ability.

### Damage
When a weapon is used against a building on your grid, you must remove one of your floor cards from that building and remove one of your building blocks from the tower on the grid. If a unit weapon (tank, artillery, infantry) was sitting atop that tower, look at that unit's card to determine if it is destroyed by the attack. 

To resolve the destruction of a floor, take your floor cards for the building that is being attacked. Shuffle those floor cards together, then fan them out facedown. Your opponent selects a card from your hand to represent the floor destroyed in the attack, and returns it to its game pile. Return the rest of your floor cards for that building back onto your play space.

In the event that you only have a single floor card for a building, return it to the game pile. If you only have the building card remaining, return the building card to the game pile.

## Victory Conditions
There are multiple ways to win the game, but only one of them will be selected before play starts. Both players will share the same victory condition, and any unselected conditions will be irrelevant.

1. Build 3 towers with 6 floors each
2. Destroy all of your opponents' buildings
3. Start a turn with 50 or more coins
